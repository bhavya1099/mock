Scenario 1: Test to Validate Correct String Returned by Method
Details:
  TestName: testCorrectStringReturned.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method returns the correct string. The target scenario is when the method is called under normal conditions.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as the method doesn't take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the publicStaticMethod.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned string against the expected string "Original public Static Method !".
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method returns the expected string. The reason behind the expected result is that the method is supposed to return a predefined string. This test is significant as it checks the basic functionality of the method.
Scenario 2: Test to Validate Non-Null Return by Method
Details:
  TestName: testNonNullReturn.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method returns a non-null value. The target scenario is when the method is called under normal conditions.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as the method doesn't take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the publicStaticMethod.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the returned string is not null.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method doesn't return null. The reason behind the expected result is that the method is supposed to return a predefined string and not null. This test is significant as it ensures that the method doesn't fail by returning null.
Scenario 3: Test to Validate Immutable Return by Method
Details:
  TestName: testImmutableReturn.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the string returned by the method is immutable. The target scenario is when an attempt is made to modify the returned string.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as the method doesn't take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the publicStaticMethod and try to change the returned string.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the original and modified strings are not the same.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the string returned by the method is immutable. The reason behind the expected result is that strings in Java are immutable. This test is significant as it ensures that the method's behavior aligns with Java's string immutability rule.
