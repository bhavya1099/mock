Scenario 1: Test when bookType is "novel"

Details:
    TestName: testWhenBookTypeIsNovel.
    Description: This test aims to check the functionality of the method when the bookType is "novel". The expected return is "novel".
  Execution:
    Arrange: Provide "novel" as the bookType parameter.
    Act: Invoke the getRes method with "novel" as the parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value is "novel".
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the method returns "novel" when the bookType is "novel". This is crucial for correctly identifying the type of book.
Scenario 2: Test when bookType is not "novel"

Details:
    TestName: testWhenBookTypeIsNotNovel.
    Description: This test aims to verify the functionality of the method when the bookType is anything other than "novel". The expected return is "movie".
  Execution:
    Arrange: Provide a string other than "novel" as the bookType parameter.
    Act: Invoke the getRes method with this string as the parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value is "movie".
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the method returns "movie" when the bookType is not "novel". This is important to ensure that the method handles all other cases correctly.
Scenario 3: Test when bookType is null

Details:
    TestName: testWhenBookTypeIsNull.
    Description: This test aims to verify the functionality of the method when the bookType is null. The expected return is "movie".
  Execution:
    Arrange: Provide null as the bookType parameter.
    Act: Invoke the getRes method with null as the parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value is "movie".
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the method returns "movie" when the bookType is null. This is significant to ensure that the method handles null inputs correctly.
Scenario 4: Test when bookType is an empty string

Details:
    TestName: testWhenBookTypeIsEmpty.
    Description: This test aims to verify the functionality of the method when the bookType is an empty string. The expected return is "movie".
  Execution:
    Arrange: Provide an empty string as the bookType parameter.
    Act: Invoke the getRes method with an empty string as the parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value is "movie".
