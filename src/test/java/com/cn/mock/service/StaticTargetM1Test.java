"""
Scenario 1: Test when m1 Method Throws a RuntimeException
Details:
  TestName: testM1ThrowsRuntimeException
  Description: This test is meant to check if the m1 method throws a RuntimeException as expected when it's invoked.
Execution:
  Arrange: No set up needed in this case as m1 doesn't interact with any member fields or arguments.
  Act: Invoke the m1 method with no parameters.
  Assert: Use JUnit 'assertThrows' method to test if a RuntimeException is being thrown.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify that the m1 method behaves as expected by throwing a RuntimeException when invoked.
  Elaborate the significance of the test verifies the functionality of the method where it throws the RuntimeException as part of its implementation, ensuring it works as expected under normal conditions.
Scenario 2: Test the Output of m1 Method
Details:
  TestName: testM1PrintsExpectedOutput
  Description: This test is meant to check if the m1 method prints the expected output to the console when it is executed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Redirect the standard console output (System.out) to a ByteArrayOutputStream so that we can capture what's printed to the console.
  Act: Invoke the m1 method.
  Assert: Compare the contents of the ByteArrayOutputStream to the expected output. Because RuntimeException will be thrown, we will wrap the m1 call in a try-catch block and ignore the exception for this test case.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies the static print message from the m1 method. It's significant in a context where the printed message is crucial to be known and understood by the user. The method is expected to print "StaticTarget m1" which is to be validated through this test case.
