  Scenario 1: Testing the RuntimeException thrown by m1 method
  Details:
    TestName: testRuntimeExceptionThrownByM1Method
    Description: This test is meant to check if the RuntimeException is thrown when the m1 method is invoked. The target scenario is the normal operation of the method.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No data or mocks are needed as m1 is a static method with no inputs.
    Act: Invoke the m1 method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if a RuntimeException is thrown.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the RuntimeException is thrown when m1 is invoked. The expected result is a RuntimeException, as this is the behavior defined in the method. This test is significant as it verifies the correct error handling of the m1 method.
  Scenario 2: Testing the System.out.println output of m1 method
  Details:
    TestName: testSystemOutPrintlnOutput
    Description: This test is meant to check if the System.out.println output is "StaticTarget m1" when the m1 method is invoked. The target scenario is the normal operation of the method.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Redirect System.out to a ByteArrayOutputStream.
    Act: Invoke the m1 method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the ByteArrayOutputStream contains "StaticTarget m1".
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the correct output is printed to the console when m1 is invoked. The expected result is "StaticTarget m1", as this is the output defined in the method. This test is significant as it verifies the correct operation of the m1 method.
  Scenario 3: Testing the execution order of m1 method
  Details:
    TestName: testExecutionOrderOfM1Method
    Description: This test is meant to check if the System.out.println is executed before the RuntimeException is thrown when the m1 method is invoked. The target scenario is the normal operation of the method.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Redirect System.out to a ByteArrayOutputStream.
    Act: Invoke the m1 method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the ByteArrayOutputStream contains "StaticTarget m1" before a RuntimeException is thrown.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the correct order of operations is followed when m1 is invoked. The expected result is "StaticTarget m1" printed before the RuntimeException is thrown, as this is the order defined in the method. This test is significant as it verifies the correct operation of the m1 method.
