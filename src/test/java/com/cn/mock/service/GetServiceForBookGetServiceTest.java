Scenario 1: Test for Novel Book Type
Details:
  TestName: testGetServiceForNovel.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getService method returns 1 when the book type is specified as "novel".
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required as there are no dependencies.
    Act: Invoke the getService method with "novel" as the parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the return value is 1.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify if the method correctly identifies the book type as "novel" and returns 1 as specified in the method. This test is significant as it validates the basic functionality of the method.
Scenario 2: Test for Non-Novel Book Type
Details:
  TestName: testGetServiceForNonNovel.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getService method returns 2 when the book type is not "novel".
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required as there are no dependencies.
    Act: Invoke the getService method with a book type other than "novel".
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the return value is 2.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify if the method correctly identifies a book type that is not "novel" and returns 2. This test is significant as it checks the method's handling of inputs other than "novel".
Scenario 3: Test for Null Book Type
Details:
  TestName: testGetServiceForNull.
  Description: This test is meant to check how the getService method handles null input.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required as there are no dependencies.
    Act: Invoke the getService method with null as the parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the return value is 2.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify if the method can handle null input and default to returning 2. This test is important for checking the robustness of the method against null inputs.
Scenario 4: Test for Empty String Book Type
Details:
  TestName: testGetServiceForEmptyString.
  Description: This test is meant to check how the getService method handles an empty string input.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required as there are no dependencies.
    Act: Invoke the getService method with an empty string as the parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the return value is 2.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify if the method can handle an empty string as input and default to returning 2. This test is important for checking the method's handling of empty string inputs.
