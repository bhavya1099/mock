ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=m2_688d67e6ba
Scenario 1: Test to verify that the RuntimeException is thrown
Details:
  TestName: testRuntimeExceptionThrown
  Description: This test is meant to check if the m2 method throws a RuntimeException as expected.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is needed as the method does not require any inputs.
  Act: Invoke the m2 method.
  Assert: Use JUnit's assertThrows to confirm that a RuntimeException is thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the RuntimeException is thrown as per the method's implementation. The significance of this test is to ensure the method behaves as expected when invoked.
Scenario 2: Test to verify the output message of the m2 method
Details:
  TestName: testOutputMessage
  Description: This test is intended to verify the output message of the m2 method by capturing the System.out content.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a PrintStream to capture the System.out content.
  Act: Invoke the m2 method.
  Assert: Use JUnit's assertEquals to compare the captured output against the expected output message.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method prints the correct message to the console. This test is significant in validating the method's functionality in terms of generating the correct output.
Scenario 3: Test to verify the type of exception thrown by the m2 method
Details:
  TestName: testExceptionType
  Description: This test is meant to confirm that the exception thrown by the m2 method is indeed a RuntimeException.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is needed as the method does not require any inputs.
  Act: Invoke the m2 method.
  Assert: Use JUnit's assertThrows to check that the thrown exception is an instance of RuntimeException.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the exception thrown is a RuntimeException, ensuring the method's error handling mechanism works as expected.
