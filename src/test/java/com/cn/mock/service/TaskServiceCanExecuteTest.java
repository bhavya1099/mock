"""
Scenario 1: Testing when task is created today
Details:
  TestName: testCanExecuteTodayTask
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method canExecute returns true when the task is created on the same day. The target scenario is when the task is created on the same day.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set taskCreateTime to the current date and time.
  Act: Invoke the canExecute method with the taskCreateTime parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome of true.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly identifies tasks created on the same day as executable. The expected result is true since the method should allow tasks created today to be executed.
Scenario 2: Testing when task is created yesterday and current time is before YESTERDAY_TASK_LIMIT_HOUR
Details:
  TestName: testCanExecuteYesterdayTaskBeforeLimitHour
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method canExecute returns true when the task is created yesterday and the current time is before YESTERDAY_TASK_LIMIT_HOUR. The target scenario is when the task is created yesterday and the current time is before YESTERDAY_TASK_LIMIT_HOUR.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set taskCreateTime to yesterday's date and time and current time to before YESTERDAY_TASK_LIMIT_HOUR.
  Act: Invoke the canExecute method with the taskCreateTime parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome of true.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly identifies tasks created yesterday and current time is before YESTERDAY_TASK_LIMIT_HOUR as executable. The expected result is true since the method should allow tasks created yesterday and current time is before YESTERDAY_TASK_LIMIT_HOUR to be executed.
Scenario 3: Testing when task is created yesterday and current time is after YESTERDAY_TASK_LIMIT_HOUR
Details:
  TestName: testCanExecuteYesterdayTaskAfterLimitHour
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method canExecute returns false when the task is created yesterday and the current time is after YESTERDAY_TASK_LIMIT_HOUR. The target scenario is when the task is created yesterday and the current time is after YESTERDAY_TASK_LIMIT_HOUR.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set taskCreateTime to yesterday's date and time and current time to after YESTERDAY_TASK_LIMIT_HOUR.
  Act: Invoke the canExecute method with the taskCreateTime parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome of false.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly identifies tasks created yesterday and current time is after YESTERDAY_TASK_LIMIT_HOUR as non-executable. The expected result is false since the method should not allow tasks created yesterday and current time is after YESTERDAY_TASK_LIMIT_HOUR to be executed.
Scenario 4: Testing when task is created two days ago
Details:
  TestName: testCanExecuteTwoDaysAgoTask
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method canExecute returns false when the task is created two days ago. The target scenario is when the task is created two days ago.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set taskCreateTime to two days ago's date and time.
  Act: Invoke the canExecute method with the taskCreateTime parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome of false.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly identifies tasks created two days ago as non-executable. The expected result is false since the method should not allow tasks created two days ago to be executed.
