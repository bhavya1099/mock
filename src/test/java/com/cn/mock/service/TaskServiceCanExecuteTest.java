  Scenario 1: Test when the task was created today

  Details:
    TestName: testCanExecuteForTaskCreatedToday
    Description: This test is meant to check if the canExecute method rightly returns true for tasks that were created today.
  Execution:
    Arrange: An instance of the method's class. A Date object representing the current date and time (equivalent to a task created today).
    Act: Invoke the canExecute method with the current date and time.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value is true.
  Validation:
    The method should return true as per the given functionality for tasks created today. It would prove the method's correctness for tasks occurring today.

  Scenario 2: Test when the task was created yesterday and time is within the limit
  Details:
    TestName: testCanExecuteForTaskCreatedYesterdayWithinTimeLimit
    Description: This test checks if canExecute method returns true for tasks created yesterday and currently the time is within the limit hour for yesterday's tasks.
  Execution:
    Arrange: An instance of the method's class. A Date object representing yesterday's date and time.
    Act: Invoke the canExecute method with the created Date.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value is true if the current hour is less than YESTERDAY_TASK_LIMIT_HOUR(8).
  Validation:
    As per the method functionality, it allows yesterday's tasks to execute before 8am. This test verifies the method correctly identifies this scenario.
  Scenario 3: Test when the task was created yesterday but time has passed the limit hour
  Details:
    TestName: testCanExecuteForTaskCreatedYesterdayPassedTimeLimit
    Description: This test verifies if canExecute method returns false for tasks created yesterday but currently the time is beyond the limit hour for yesterday's tasks.
  Execution:
    Arrange: An instance of the method's class. A Date object with yesterday's date.
    Act: Invoke the canExecute method with the created Date.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value is false if the current hour is beyond YESTERDAY_TASK_LIMIT_HOUR(8).
  Validation:
    The method needs to return false for yesterday's tasks when current time is past the limit hour. This test verifies the method's accuracy for this scenario.

  Scenario 4: Test when task creation date is not today or yesterday

  Details:
    TestName: testCanExecuteForTaskNotCreatedTodayOrYesterday
    Description: This test checks that the canExecute method correctly returns false for tasks not created either today or yesterday.
  Execution:
    Arrange: An instance of the method's class. A Date object with a date older than yesterday.
    Act: Invoke the canExecute method using the created Date object.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value should be false.
  Validation:
    This test ensures the method correctly handles tasks that are older than yesterday i.e. it should not allow their execution and return false.
